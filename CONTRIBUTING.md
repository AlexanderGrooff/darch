I'd love some help! :)

# How to contribute

Create an issue (or see if it exists already) before you start on any new features. That way, we can discuss it. For small issues/improvements, just create a pull request! Also, I try to flag easy issues with "good first issue".

Before you commit your changes, be sure to run `make test && make lint`. Otherwise, the build server will flag it.

I'll probably ask that you squash your commits to a single commit, if required.
